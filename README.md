# initial-reserves-of-natural-gas-in-a-deposit-using-the-p-z-method
Application for determination of the initial reserves of natural gas in a deposit using the p/z method

Input data:<br/>
a) set of pairs: pressure [bar] - total natural gas production [million Nm3]; <br/>
b) reservoir temperature [K];<br/>
c) composition of natural gas [mole percentage]; assumption: mixture of methane, ethane, propane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen.<br/>

a) a diagram illustrating the p/z method;<br/>
b) the initial reserves of natural gas in the field [million Nm3].<br/>
